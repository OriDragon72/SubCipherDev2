# SubCipherDev2

## Introduction
This project is a Python script that aims to decipher an encrypted message, passed through a Substitution cipher, without the ‘key’ used. This would require the use of “frequency analysis”. The creator is not liable for the misuse of this tool. It is to be used for educational purposes only.

## File Structure
- `Main.py`: Python script for the 'Decipherer'.
- `AttemptI.txt`: My first attempt.
- `extra.txt`: Snippet from a past idea.
- `LICENSE`: A text file that contains the license.
- `README.md`: A text file that has the documentation.

## Usage
1. Run the `Main.py` script.
2. Enter the the text you would like to decrypt.
3. Wait for the magic to happen and the results will be printed on the screen

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: None
